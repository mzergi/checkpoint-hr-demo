# Introduction 
Demo state of the enterprise management application currently in development.

The application lets users create employees, skills, and other employee related data. Includes extensive testing, mocks, API, Business Logic and Data Access layers, with generic CRUD classes.

Current state: CRUD functionality of the API is verified by hand, however the current API tests are failing. This is what I am currently fixing.
